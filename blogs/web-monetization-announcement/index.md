# Say Hi to Web Monetization

We are delighted to announce that Hashnode now supports Web Monetization. This feature was requested by a lot of users and the new update brings it to you. You can finally monetize your blog and earn money from the user's attention. ðŸŽ‰

## What is Web Monetization

Web Monetization is a browser API that allows the creation of micropayment streams. It uses Interledger to generate these payments and send them directly to the content creator's account. The payment stream starts only when the reader is consuming your content and stops as soon as the tab is switched or closed.

As a creator/consumer, you don't have to worry about exchange rates or the amount of content you're consuming. The micropayments are small and spread in a way that maximum exhaust limit is just $5 no matter how much you're reading (if you're using coil).

## How can I monetize my Hashnode blog

This involves two simple steps:

1. Setup a Payment Pointer
2. Add it to Dashboard

### 1. Setup a Payment Pointer

A payment pointer makes it possible to transfer payment without sacrificing user's privacy. It's a unique URL assigned to your payment account. Here is how you can create one:

1. Signup to Uphold or Gatehub.
2. Tap on Interledger under fund my account. It will generate a payment pointer.
3. Copy the payment pointer and press done.

### 2. Add it to Dashboard

You just have to add payment pointer in the dashboard:

1. Go to the Monetization tab on the dashboard.
2. Paste payment pointer and click on "Update settings"

You'll now receive micro-payment whenever someone visits your blog on a browser setup with web monetization. The payments now will be small but this is a really promising feature and will likely change the way how we consume content in the future. We expect more and more people to set up monetization on Hashnode and start earning.

We believe that this is the right step towards a safer web that supports both content creators and the reader's privacy. With Hashnode, you own your content and this adds another meaning to that statement where you own the profit you get from your content as well.
