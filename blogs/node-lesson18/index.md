description: We will learn how to handle system files using fs module and using binary data
- function types: fs module has various method and these have two variants. synchronous and asynchronous. synchronous one will have Sync as suffix
- sync methods will slow down the execution. why? because it waits for the completion of method called and it won't run any further
- that's why we use async one, it enables us to take help of event loop and handle the task at hand efficiently
- talk about readFile and writeFile
- google what else we can include and probably some gotchas
