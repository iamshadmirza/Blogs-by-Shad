# 15 Tips to Help you Grow as a Developer

Hello everyone, I will be sharing some tips that have helped me in past to grow as a developer and keep my stress level low. I am someone you usually do a lot in finite amount of time and often feel overwhelemed by it. These are the things which I have tried and found helpful.

## 1. When there is too much on the Plate, Grab a Bowl

This is my personal favourite because more often than not, I find myself juggling between work, blogging, drawing, coding tutorials and other stuff. This has been a saviour so far.

This means that take a bowl, get one item from the plate, put it in bowl and start eating.  
Don't think about how much you have on plate, just try to finish up the bowl as soon as possible and grab another item.

## 2. The 15 Minute Rule

Try any difficult task for 15 minutes before asking or seeking for help. This will build your mind muscle to search for answers instead of depending on others. The more we force our brain to do, the more we get better 💪.

## 3. Single Point of Focus

You should focus on one and only one thing at a time. Just forget that there is anything in the world that matters except the task at hand.

## 4. Work is Sacred, Treat it like that

Work should be sacred and free from distractions. Isolation is the key to build focus. Use a separate room or mild music to mute the world.

## 5. Do any Activity for a Prolonged Period of Time to Build Focus

Activities like Reading and Listening to podcasts/audiobooks for a long duration like 40-50 minutes enhances your willpower and focus. Do not touch, do or think anything while you're doing that and keep a keen focus on the activity you're up to. You will get distracted, bring your focus back to the activity and continue. This **bring your focus back** part is how you practice focus. Being focused is a skill that can be built with practice.

## 6. Sleep without Alarm

Our sleep is consist of cycles. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 cycles are good as long as they are complete but 4½, 5⅔ or 8⅝ is not good. Point is that it doesn't matter how long or short you're sleeping. The appropriate number of cycles to heal your body should be complete and that depends on the day you just had. Also, it should be complete.

When you're waking up with alarm, you are disrupting that cycle which will make you tired. When you press *snooze* button and go to sleep, you have already disrupted a cycle then started a new one by sleeping again. Which will eventually break again in 15 minutes. Result? You end up tired even after sleeping ample amount of time. Trust your body, it will wake you up when your body is ready to wake up.

## 7. Rituals over Willpower

Following rituals is an amazing way to build your willpower. Things like making your bed when you wake up, reading 25 pages daily, waking up and sleeping at the same time every single day. This helps your mind to stay organised and not think about a lot of stuff because they are self organised. This gives your brain enough space to think about important stuff like task at work or creative ideas.

Start with something small and stack the activities in one order. Example:

Wakeup> Brush> Tea>15 min walk> Read 25 pages> Document tasks of the day>Check Phone> Bath> Open laptop.

## 8. The 5 minute rule

Our brain generates pain like signals when we try to do a difficult task which we can be simply be avoid and that's how procrastination happens. You brain start looking for other activities which rather give pleasure to avoid this pain and you end watching "How to talk to turtle" video after hours of surfing on Youtube. (guilty). But here is a trick. This pain signal disappears after few minutes of you doing that task which you were avoiding.

So what I use to trick my brain is I tell myself that I'm going to do this for 5 minutes and then I'll get up. I call this "5 minute rule" because I'm bad at naming things. You start doing work and after 5 minutes, that pain signal is gone and you end up spending more time than you decided. It works like a charm and you should definitely try this out.

At this point, I'm pretty convinced that I'm bad at naming stuff. Feel free to suggest a better name for this rule in the comments.

## 9. Multi Tasking is a Myth

Context switching is hard. It takes a lot of brain resources and only comes enormous practice. It's better to focus on thing at a time and then focus on another after that. This efficiently uses your brain's full power almost like a high intensity laser pointed out a point. Water hose example here. I have written a [detailed article](https://iamshadmirza.com/multitasking-is-a-myth-heres-why) on this topic.

## 10. Exercise daily even if it's just walking

I'm not saying to build having muscles but it's good to have a mild workout daily. Walking fast does come into mild exercise. It fills the bloog with lot of oxygen and send it to every corner of your body. Not to forget, this is essential for your brain to recieve fresh, oxygenated blood filled to work perfectly.

## 11. Be a Part of a Community

Being among creative thinkers encourages your own creativity. Having other like minded people around you boosts your moral and helps you improve in all sort of fields. That's why being a part of community is very important if you want to grow as a developer. Use twitter and linked to find a community and share knowledge.

## 12. Food for thoughts

Whatever goes in, comes out. This is as simple as that. That's why food for thoughts is a essential. Start your day by listening to a good podcast, a TED talk or read a book. Even 10 minutes are enough. Listen to somethings that imparts a wisdom you didn't knew before. Listen to people who have diverse perspective in how they see the world. Take whatever good is there in the world.

## 13. Shutdown Ritual

## 14. Reward Hours

Get dedicated reward hour

## 15. Mind Dump

The problem with most of the productivity guides are, they will tell you what to do but not how to do it. Although I can't gaurantee that these strategies will surely help you. But I will suggest you to try and see what works for you. That's it now.  Take care and stay safe.
