# From Nothing to Hashnode: My Tech Journey

Hello everyone, it's almost the end of the year 2020 and since everyone was sharing how this year went for them, I thought of sharing it too. This is my coding journey from nothing to joining [Hashnode Team](https://hashnode.com/about). It's going to be a long ride so hold tight. üöó

## College Ended, Now What?

I studied from a Tier 4 college in Uttar Pradesh, India. As you might expect, it did a poor job of education and till the time I had degree in my hand, I only knew how to make portfolio using JSP pages. That's it.  

I was not good in coding too, I got 30/100 marks in C and Java. These were the only two subjects in our academic year for coding. And now I have completed my B.Tech with nothing to show. We didn't have placements at college so usual way of getting a job was to go to Noida or Bangalore and apply at every mass recruitment happening. I did the same, went to Jaipur first and applied at Infosys for a job.

This is me at the one of the college for placements after practicing how to print star pattern in C. I knew the basics so cleared the coding round but failed at some later stage.

Now it was time to go to Bangalore. All of my friends were going and had asked me to tag along. I refused. Why?

I asked one question to myself, "Why should anyone will hire me?"

I didn't have an answer so I decided to prepare before I go for job hunt.

## Preparing for Job Hunt

I thought about what I can do to prepare something quickly. I knew Java basics and JSP pages so I decided to learn Java from Youtube then try Android Development. This is year 2018 June and Bucky Roberts is doing some amazing job at tutorials. I learned Java from [this playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFE2CE09D83EE3E28) and moved on to learn Android Development from [these tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6gx4Cwl9DGBsvRxJJOzG4r4k_zLKrnxl). I didn't know about udemy at this time so youtube was my saviour. It took me three months to prepare and get good enough to build a basic app with firebase backend. Now it was job hunt time but that didn't happen. Let me tell you how.

## How I Got My First Job

My college was situated in Lucknow city and there was an ongoing project of Lucknow metro at that time. The government website was terrible and I decided to make an app for the same.

The app had all the stations, map and fair calculator. It was also printing the route back and forth on screen. To make this basic app little interesting, I stored the station data on firebase and added authentication. Once saved, user can save few routes for quick view. That was all.

I was excited after building this since this was my first real project so I recorded a video and posted on my whatsapp status. Someone took that video and sent to his friend in Bangalore and I got the interview. I came to Bangalore, gave the interview and got the job üéâ. All thanks to Bucky Roberts Sir üôè

My friends who came here 3 months ago are still searching for a job and will keep searching for 6 more months. In that sense, staying back was a good idea.

There is one little catch here, this is an early stage startup with no funding so salary was really low, I was hardly able to afford my living there. I have heard that startups don't really pay for 3 months but that was a chance I was willing to take. 

Since the pay was so very low and few of my friends were already placed in MNCs with much higher pay. Everyone I knew from friends to family suggested to not go for startup and apply at MNC. My father said "Do you what feel is better for you" and that was something I wanted to hear.

I thought the worst case could be I won't get paid for an year while keep working and I will have to start fresh next year with no proof of experience. I thought I can take this risk and losing one year not be that bad at this age. As long as I know how to code, I can do something. I took my chances and joined this startup on October 22 2018. The rollercoaster begins from here.

## The Startup Experience

It turned out that I was the only developer they hired to build the app because of low budget. I was literally working sitting alone on the chair in entire hall. I didn't have required android experience so my job mostly consist of research on how to implement things and then doing it on the same. It was difficult but couldn't ask for a better situation to learn and grow fast.

The project continued for 2 months and the senior folks decided to abandon it and go with React Native instead. But wait, I'm Java Developer not JavaScript. I don't know a thing about JavaScript.

That's what I said. I was told to learn React Native in 2 weeks. I learned the basics of React Native in about 18 days and started the project. I didn't learn JavaScript first and kept learning what's necessary as things came in React Native roadmap.

Things are pretty slow if you try to build android app on 4GB RAM laptop so it took sometime for me catch up. In the meantime, someone introduced me to Udemy and I got a React Native course by Stephen Course. It was a life saviour. I realised that I was doing almost everything wrong and since there was no one to check and guide, I kept doing it till I got this course.

Startups are sure a great way to learn things quickly with handson approach but it takes a toll on your mind and body. I was coding 12-15 hours a day non-stop. No meetings, no standups, just get to work and start coding till the work hour ends. Go back home and code some more because unrealistic deadlines. 

The app was something like a cab, food, grocery and medicine ordering in one app. This was way too complicated and the job was particularly difficult because I had no one to ask to when I get stuck somewhere. It did help me develop problem solving ability but at a cost of lot of stress. Not to forget the occasional insults when a task was not completed on that unrealistic deadline. I was popping headache pills every single day at one point and used to take unpaid leave just to sit back and relax so I don't lose my sanity. If you find yourself in similar situation, leave as soon as possible.

I developed around 5 apps with backend in 1 year of working at this startup. I was growing at a rate that I was a totally different person every single month. We will talk some more on startup in a little while in this blog post.

## Meetups: Wait, What's that?

During all this, I joined twitter and got introduced with meetups happening in Bangalore. I went to a React Native Meetup organised by GeekyAnts. It was a wonderful experience. While these meetups were totally free but it used to cost me 1000 INR. Since I don't have any leaves and I have to work 6 days a week at minimum. I had to give some excuse at work and attend meetup. This will result in my salary deduction but it was worth the experience.

I got to know a lot amazing folks from tech and instantly connected them on twitter. This opened my way to mentorship. Let me tell you how.

## Mentorship

While trial and error is still as effective as ever, having a proper mentor will help you a lot in getting your goals faster. But since I worked alone, I didn't have any mentor.

I decided to follow what others are doing. I was really fascinated by 3 people in our Indian tech industry who were doing some amazing job. I turned on tweet notifications and started watching them. You won't believe how much information you can get from this single. I'm calling in Indirect Mentorship since the mentor has no idea that he is mentoring me.

I learned that people love MobX, Design System, and more importantly blogging for some reason. So I tried all of it except blogging.

I was sure of one thing that I don't know anything. And blogging is about sharing your knowledge so I hesitated at writing a blog. But then I asked a particular someone about what to do when I don't have experience. He wrote [this blog](https://sid.st/post/start-a-blog/) on May 17 2019 and it resolved all my concerns. After reading this blog, I posted [my first blog](https://iamshadmirza.com/how-to-align-and-justify-your-flex-item-in-first-try) post on Hashnode on May 20 2019. This was going to be a turning point in my career (again).

## The Blogging Journey

I started writing more blogs. Whenever I learn something new, I will write about it to test my knowledge. I got better at writing and my article got selected among [Top 10 articles in Nodejs](https://medium.mybridge.co/node-js-top-10-articles-for-the-past-month-v-july-2019-2cca3caa76f6) among 1000 posts in June 2019. What better motivation could this be for writing more. üôåüéâ

After this I went on to write for [gitconnected.com](https://gitconnected.com/), [alligator.io](https://alligator.io/) and few other publication.

This little achievement opened my way to many more opportunity and at a very right time. Let me tell you how.

## Freelance Journey

After few weeks of this, the company stopped paying me salary because they ran out of funds. And the salary was low to begin with, so I didn't have any saving to afford living in Bangalore.

Because of writing for these publication, I got approached for writing tech articles and get paid. My first earning from writing was $30 and it was a ghost blogging. If you don't know about ghost blogging, it's when you write and get paid but you won't get the content. Few folks do this to create quality content to get more traffic and hopefully some freelancing.

At this point of time, my posts were present in few top publications and I started getting freelancing gigs. What a perfect time.

I did few freelance projects to sustain the living but it was very difficult. Since I was spending around 10-12 hours on work, I barely had time to do anything else let alone blogging. I needed a solution.

I tried stretching the work at night but I was so tired to do anything at all. So I decided to wakeup early. I would wake up at 4 every morning and work on freelancing projects until 9 then head to job at 10. Few mornings were dedicated for projects and few for blogging. This was more than enough to afford living in Bangalore.

Only problem was, it was way too hard and work culture was affecting my mental health. I wanted to leave this job and go back home.

## Quit the Job

The pressure was unbearable and hearing insults daily after working hard was not something I can keep doing. I decided to quit and printing a resignation to submit. Remember those 3 folks from tech industry who were my indirect mentors. I approached one of them on twitter and consulted my problem. I said I can't do this anymore and I am going to quit, is this right decision?

He stopped me from doing it and told me how difficult it is to find a job without any job. I had to keep working for a little longer until I get a better offer. Hence, I didn't submit my resignation.

## First Interview

I interviewed at a company in Bangalore. I told them I am trained coder, I am self taught so I might not be familiar with terminologies you use in company but I can code. Interview experience was great but I didn't perform. To be precise, I performed poorly and I hated myself for that. I got an offer for fresher but I didn't take it.

I decided to prepare and apply again in next 6 months.

I already had a system in place which allowed me to stretch my day. I stopped doing freelancing, blogging for a while and dedicated whole time to learning.

If this interview didn't happen at this time, I would have continued doing the same thing and never would have realise that I have to level up the game. This was an eye opening experience for me which told me everything about what I needed to improve to get a job in a good company.

## More on Mentorship

While all this is going on, I came to know about Tanay Pratap and joined the telegram group. It is called as team tanay. Tanay works at Microsoft and has been teaching code to students on youtube. More importantly, he genuinely cared about students future and gave really helpful advice. I instantly noticed that this is a great source of guidance.

I kept noticing noticing whatever he was sharing on instagram or telegram and took whatever I can. It was not a direct one to one interaction at this time. I was just observing him closely. Example, this picture was set as group logo and I thought that this book must be good since he likes it so much to put on group logo.

I read this book "So good they can't ignore you" and it was everything I was trying to do. He kept dropping helpful advice like build your portfolio, make projects and apply for interview, build online presence through blogging. I was doing these without noticing the impact. I started adding more efforts to my projects/blogs to showcase on my profile in order to get a better job.

A while after that, Tanay launched his first podcast "Tea with Tanay". He would invite people and talk about their experiences on a range of topics. Again, this is also a super valuable source of guidance. I approached him directly to thank for this and asked if there is any way I can help. That's how I started writing blogs on tea with Tanay. It was like supplementary reading for the listeners. It was wonderful collaborating with him.

That's how I got from having no mentor to having 4 amazing mentors.

> If you know Tanay, you might be familiar with team tanay job challenge. My encounter with tanay was way before that happened. I would say that the job challenge is a consolidation of all the advice he was sharing in group to get a job. If you're looking for a job, you should [check it out](https://2020.teamtanay.jobchallenge.dev/).

## My Breakthrough Project

My salary was still on and off at this time, I didn't know if I would be paid this month or not. So I had no choice but to look for some freelancing. Because of the blogs, I had people approaching for collaboration so I never had to actually search for a freelance project.

As I did more and more work on React Native, I found out that I had a lot of components already build which I was copy pasting everywhere and tweaking the theme a little. I thoughts why not group them all and create a library flexible enough to work with any freelance project I had. I did exactly that.

I was interested in Design Systems so I read a lot about them and took the best of all the library to create a system for me. It was perfect for my needs and I was able to build UI way faster.

I open sourced this project and published to NPM as [React Native Design System](https://github.com/iamshadmirza/react-native-design-system). Building a library for general usecase and copy pasting components are two different things. It wasn't easy but I get to learn a lot of different stuff.

I finally released React Native Design System on Feb 22 2020.

## Job Offers

I received a total of 5 offers (3 Bangalore startups & 2 overseas remote) within a day of launching my library. I was surprised with the reaction it got from the community. It was almost like a dream ü§Ø.

All that hardwork, waking up early when you don't feel like waking, writing when you don't feel like writing, building when you don't feel like building is going to pay off. To be honest, I was over the moon. It was just magical. Let's talk about Hashnode now ü§©.

## Joining Hashnode

I have loved Hashnode even before I joined as a full stack developer. Maybe that's what Sandeep noticed and approached me to join the team in Bangalore.

If you've read so far, you might have guessed that my life started changing since the point I wrote my first blog on Hashnode. It holds a important place in my career. I am really passionate about blogging and I encourage everyone to do it too.

The satisfaction you get from contributing to something that you yourself believe in is priceless. I love working here and feel fortunate to work with this amazing team. On this note, I think the Hashnode team deserves a separate section.

## Working at Hashnode

Hashnode is fully remote so I get to work from my home. The team is supportive, approachable and really fun. It hardly ever feels like working when you're having so much fun. When I joined Hashnode, I didn't have much experience on web and still managed to work because I had people at my back for support. From PR reviews to testing, from pixel perfect UI to elegant UX, I got to learn everything. Let me introduce you to team  at hashnode:

1. Sandeep Panda: CTO and a geek at heart. I would feel really proud if I can achieve his level of expertise. I learned how to ask better questions from Sandeep. Asking right questions is half of solving the problem. Once you know what problems to solve, you can easily go ahead and break into smaller chunks.
2. Syed Fazle Rahman: CEO and CSS Wizard at Hashnode. If you love Hashnode UI, all the credit goes to Fazle. I'm still learning how to build better UX from him and there is a lot to learn there. We ask him to sprinkle some pinch of magic when we build UI.
3. Vamsi Settipalli: Me and Vamsi joined almost together. He is really good when it comes to prototyping a new feature. He loves experimenting.
4. Girish Patil: Oldest member of Hashnode, we call him Godly Girish sometimes. No matter how complicated problem you throw at him, you can be sure that it will be solved. Problems are scared when they hear Girish is assigned to them.
5. Edidiong Asinkpo: The ever energetic Didi is Dev Advocate at Hashnode. It's such a pleasure to work with her.
6. Shad: You know me already.

Although we are a team of 6 at the moment but this section will be incomplete without mentioning Bolaji. Bolaji was Developer Advocate when I joined and was a part of Hashnode team for a year. Always ready to help no matter when you ask.

That's all of us. 

## Tech Speaking

My breakthrough project was really a breakthrough for lot of opportunities. Right after the launch, I got an opportunity to speak at React Bangalore about the my library.

%[https://twitter.com/ReactBangalore/status/1225360307121356800?s=20]

I am introvert and it scares me to bones whenever I hear that I have to speak. And speaking in front of 200 people was the scariest thing I can do. I said Yes anyway.

This was a fear that I wanted to get over with. [Kiran Abhuri](https://twitter.com/kiran_abburi) and [Aditya Agarwal](https://twitter.com/dev__adi) are two amazing people who are experienced in public speaking. I prepared a talk and presented in front of them. Gathered feedback and improvised. Then finally presented at the meetup. 

Here is a little advice. Do the things that you are scared to do. Being scared is not a bad thing, it's just that it will be little more difficult for you. But the fear will make you extra conscious and make you perform well. Our instincts are at their best when we are scared.

Sadly, the pandemic happened after that and I couldn't speak at more physical events. I have given two online talks in this pandemic.

## What's Next

I was working as Full Stack Developer and recently got promoted to a senior role after working for 10 months. All I can say this has been an amazing journey and it won't be possible if I didn't have the luck to meet so many people who helped me reach here. I was not able to mention few folks who played a very important role in holding me when I was down. It's never an win-win journey, you're going to see failure even though you tried your best. The idea is to keep going no matter what.

I don't have a new year resolution yet. I'll try to keep doing what has worked for me so far. Excited to watch how 2021 is going to unravel.

## Takeaways

There are few very important lessons I learned that I am going to keep with myself throughout my life. I would like to share with you.

1. Hard work always pays off. Believe it and keep hustling.
2. Whole journey might have felt like a result of pure luck. There is way to make the luck work in your favour. **Luck is being at the right place at the right time.** Try lot of stuff, fail lot, be at a lot of places at a lot of times. Hopefully, something will work.
3. Don't undermine the effect of toxic work culture. Leave as soon as possible even at a cost of less pay. It might affect you for a long time.
4. What goes in, comes back. Contribute to community and community will contribute to your success. Try to be helpful.
5. Difficult situation require extra efforts. Choose what you can sacrifice to get what you want wisely. For me, it was early morning sleep.
6. Ask for help. Community is very welcoming and I'm sure it will help you. Reach out to me if you want. It's the least I can do to give back to community.
7. Blogging is powerful. Best way to learn is write and you should definitely blog.
8. Try the scary stuff. It will help you outgrow your fear.
9. Make growth your number one priority. Always become better that what you were yesterday.
10. Be So Good That They Can't Ignore You üòâ
