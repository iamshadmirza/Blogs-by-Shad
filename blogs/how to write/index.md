# How to write blog without motivation

Hey folks, I will be sharing my approach to writing blogs with least effort. Sometimes, I don't have much will power to write a lengthy blog and the thought of writing 2000 words just puts me into procastination mode.

This is what helps me make my approach a little easier. Let's start.

> This is not an opinionated blog. What works for me may not work for you. You gotta try for yourself and see if it fits.

The idea is to divide the whole flow into small chunks. Our brain usually try to avoid hard work and this makes sure the work is not hard. These are the required 5 mini tasks that adds up to complete the blog.

## Mini Task 1: Write a Description

Write a short description of the blog which includes:

- Why you want to write about
- How it's going to help your reader
- What will be prerequisite that people must know to follow along and
- The takeaways from your blog.

It will help you pin point the intent and audience of your blog, the starting and ending point of your article. This is the scope of your article and it doesn't have to be lengthy. 4-5 lines works fine for me.

***Example:** I want to write about Animation in React Native. This will be for beginner and the reader should be familiar with useEffect hook. I will use Animated API to create a rotate animation and explain how Animated API and interpolation works in React Native.*

## Mini Task 2: Write Steps as Bullet Points

Your article most probably consist of steps that a reader will do if it's a coding tutorial. If not, there will different ideas that you want to share, they can consist in separate sections. These can also be key points that you want to mention in the blog.

We are going to write these steps/ideas/key-points as bullet points. You don't have to write anything inside the points yet. You just want an skeleton to fill in.

Example:

- Created a loading screen with an image and loading text at the center.
- Create `useRotation` hook to animate value and provide a relative degree of rotation.
- Imported that hook and use it to rotate the logo.

Now you have the skeleton that you can use as a guide to write your blog. This makes writing a lot simpler.

## Mini Task 3: Fill in the Skeleton

You have the skeleton now and you know what to write. Go ahead and fill in the details. Once you're done, you will have your first draft ready.

## Mini Task 4: Sleep on it

No matter how good you feel about your first draft. There will always be room for improvement, **that's why it's called first draft.** Sleep on it and take a fresh look next day. It will give a fresh perspective that will help you refine your blog.

Don't forget to add Takeaways at the end if it makes sense. Most of the readers look for that info.

## Mini Task 5: Check for Errors and Publish

It's finally the time to share your work with the world. But before that, make sure you have not done any punctuation errors or spelling mistakes.

You can use Grammarly to check for error and make correct.
