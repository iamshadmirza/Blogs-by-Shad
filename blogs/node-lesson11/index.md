description: In this lesson, we will learn how to build Echo server. We will ping a certain site and get the response in form of echo. By echo, I mean that we will be able to receive message whatever we send. It will be like reflection of our request message just like an echo. We will also learn about status code and headers that are associated with any request.

- create a server
- , if no clear command is given or no response is written, will do nothing. Browser will wait. Explain how req and res works.  If you don’t tell the server “send back a response it will send nothing back. 
- How to receive a message i.e. parse message as query from url
- what is pathname and query
- second parameter of url.parse(req.url, true) makes it object
- what are headers
- talk about 'Cache-control', 'no-cache'
- what are different types of headers we can use
